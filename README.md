## Option 1: Old city of Bern

Medival Sandstone Buildings, with well decorated windows, archways, they usually have a triangular roof and distinct base that often includes an entrance to the basement.

These buildings have a variety of differently shaped but well layed out windows, almost all of them include a very tiny balcony overhang.

The base floor is usually a roofed walkway with archways that you can access by going up a few stairsteps from the main street, next to that staircase is usually another staircase that leads to the basement.

## Option 2: Subnautica Bases

Futuristic underwater buildings that are made out of mainly curved and round components.

These bases are made out of mainly 2 types of components: Round large rooms and cylindrical tubes, the tubes come in standard I-variants, curved L-variants, as well as T and + shapes. the rooms have 6 sides connections that can either act as connections or have a window / reinforcement plane attached to them.

Main assets are the two type of base rooms (tube/large room)
windows / reinforcement planes / entrance (hatch)
There are usually yellow handrails around the building,
and also long pilalrs that connect the components to the surrounding terrain.

# Assignment Description

In this homework you’ll gain more experience with tool creation and loops. The core of this homework will be following a Procedural House tutorial to create a multi-floor building generator. The tutorial is linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIe97023sDk&t=979s&ab_channel=SimonHoudini

## Setup and Planning

Before you begin on this project, skim through the tutorial and then pick a building type/style you’d like to emulate (either from photos or concept art). You should watch the entirety of the tutorial before committing to a style so you can pick something that is manageable and will be achievable using the techniques in the tutorial.
Of course, you’re welcome to adapt the setup to support additional logic/features to match your style, and particularly complex additions could merit extra credit :) On the other hand, if you’re newer to Houdini and want to stick relatively close to the tutorial, that’s okay too. Just be sure to think through what changes your chosen buildings will require (additional assets? different placement logic?) before diving into the project so you don’t bite off more than you can chew.
Make sure the include the reference you select in your README, and don’t forget to credit your sources.
Here are a few examples of possible building styles that could be a decent fit for inspiration: CIS 5660 HW03 Procedural Building 1 https://www.behance.net/gallery/23773965/ISOBuilding-concept-art
